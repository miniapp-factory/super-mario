+Code the following app
+```
+Create a simple side-scrolling Super Mario–style game. The player controls Mario, who can move left, move right, and jump using three on-screen buttons placed at the bottom of the screen (left arrow, right arrow, and jump button). Mario automatically faces the direction he is moving.
+
+Mario can defeat enemies by jumping on their heads. When Mario destroys an enemy, the enemy disappears with a small bounce animation and Mario earns points. Collecting coins also adds points to the score. A scoreboard at the top-right corner displays the current score.
+
+The game consists of six stages total.
+
+Stages 1–5: Each stage is a short horizontal level with simple platforms, 3–6 enemies, and 5–10 coins. Reaching the flag at the right side of the map completes the stage and moves the player to the next one.
+
+Stage 6 (Boss Stage): At the end of the sixth stage, Mario must defeat a larger boss enemy. The boss requires three successful head-jumps to be destroyed. After the boss is defeated, display a “Victory!” screen with the final score.
+
+If Mario touches an enemy from the side or bottom, or falls off the map, he loses a life and restarts the stage. Mario has 3 lives total. When all lives are lost, show a “Game Over” screen with a button to restart from Stage 1.
+
+Background music loops softly during gameplay, and a short sound plays when Mario jumps, defeats an enemy, takes damage, finishes a stage, or defeats the boss.
+
+After finishing the game or getting a Game Over screen, the user should be able to share their score.
+
+Place the Super Mario game on the home page.
